Pick a color, then click on a cell to place an energy pawn

Great!

There are 3 robots on the board. All of them follow this simple rule:

Robots can only move in cells with a pawn of their color.

The Red robot can go in cells with a pawn of any color.

Let’s move a robot! Click on one of the robot, and then click on each cell to create a path, when you are done, click on ‘confirm robot path’.

The robot moved!

You need to have the robots in your side. Your side is always at the bottom (unless you are playing offline).

You can only have 4 energy paws at the same time

When you have 3 or less pawns, you can reload your energy pawns from the reserve, but the reserve isn’t unlimited.

On the top you can see the reserve status. Under your name, you can see how many paws You have.

When the last pawn of any color is taken from the reserve, the game immediately stops, and the winner is the player with the most bots in their side.

The tutorial has ended! You can Play Online with friends or Offline with persons that are physically next to you
